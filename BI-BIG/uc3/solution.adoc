= UC3 solution

I chose 4 datasets, all containing data from the Czech Republic throughout year 2020:

 1. Death reasons
 2. Hospitalizations
 3. List of economic subjects
 4. Helper table mapping districts to cities

My idea was to watch how number of open restaurants is influencing hospitalizations and deaths, to watch death reasons and number of deaths in various cities and months.
