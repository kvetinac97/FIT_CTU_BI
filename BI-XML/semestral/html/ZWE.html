                     A series of trading states developed in the area of Zimbabwe prior to the arrival
                     of the first European explorers; the largest of these was the Kingdom of Zimbabwe
                     (ca. 1220-1450). In the 1880s, European colonists arrived with the British South Africa
                     Company (BSAC), which obtained mining rights and established company rule over the
                     area. The southern portion of BSAC holdings were annexed by the UK in 1923 and became
                     the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored
                     whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence, but
                     the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights for the
                     black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla
                     uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980.
                     Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister, was the country's only ruler (as
                     president since 1987) from independence until his resignation in November 2017. His
                     chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in 1997 and intensified after 2000,
                     caused an exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in widespread
                     shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation, MUGABE rigged
                     the 2002 presidential election to ensure his reelection.

                     In 2005, the capital city of Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly
                     an urban rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of the homes or
                     businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the opposition. MUGABE in 2007 instituted
                     price controls on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store shelves
                     empty for months. General elections in both 2008 and 2013 were severely flawed and
                     widely condemned, but allowed MUGABE to remain president. As a prerequisite to holding
                     the 2013 election, Zimbabwe enacted a new constitution by referendum, although many
                     provisions in the new constitution have yet to be codified in law. In November 2017,
                     Vice President Emmerson MNANGAGWA took over following a military intervention that
                     forced MUGABE to resign. MNANGAGWA was inaugurated president days later, promising
                     to hold presidential elections in 2018. In July 2018, MNANGAGWA won the presidential
                     election after a close contest with Movement for Democratic Change Alliance candidate
                     Nelson CHAMISA. MNANGAGWA has since resorted to the government's longstanding practice
                     of violently disrupting protests or opposition rallies. Official inflation rates soared
                     in 2019, approaching 500% by the end of the year. MUGABE died in September 2019.

                     <div class="col-12"><b>Overview: </b>
                        Zimbabwe's economy depends heavily on its mining and agriculture sectors. Following
                        a contraction from 1998 to 2008, the economy recorded real growth of more than 10%
                        per year in the period 2010-13, before falling below 3% in the period 2014-17, due
                        to poor harvests, low diamond revenues, and decreased investment. Lower mineral prices,
                        infrastructure and regulatory deficiencies, a poor investment climate, a large public
                        and external debt burden, and extremely high government wage expenses impede the country’s
                        economic performance.
                        Until early 2009, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) routinely printed money to fund
                        the budget deficit, causing hyperinflation. Adoption of a multi-currency basket in
                        early 2009 - which allowed currencies such as the Botswana pula, the South Africa
                        rand, and the US dollar to be used locally - reduced inflation below 10% per year.
                        In January 2015, as part of the government’s effort to boost trade and attract foreign
                        investment, the RBZ announced that the Chinese renmimbi, Indian rupee, Australian
                        dollar, and Japanese yen would be accepted as legal tender in Zimbabwe, though transactions
                        were predominantly carried out in US dollars and South African rand until 2016, when
                        the rand’s devaluation and instability led to near-exclusive use of the US dollar.
                        The government in November 2016 began releasing bond notes, a parallel currency legal
                        only in Zimbabwe which the government claims will have a one-to-one exchange ratio
                        with the US dollar, to ease cash shortages. Bond notes began trading at a discount
                        of up to 10% in the black market by the end of 2016.
                        Zimbabwe’s government entered a second Staff Monitored Program with the IMF in 2014
                        and undertook other measures to reengage with international financial institutions.
                        Zimbabwe repaid roughly $108 million in arrears to the IMF in October 2016, but financial
                        observers note that Zimbabwe is unlikely to gain new financing because the government
                        has not disclosed how it plans to repay more than $1.7 billion in arrears to the World
                        Bank and African Development Bank. International financial institutions want Zimbabwe
                        to implement significant fiscal and structural reforms before granting new loans.
                        Foreign and domestic investment continues to be hindered by the lack of land tenure
                        and titling, the inability to repatriate dividends to investors overseas, and the
                        lack of clarity regarding the government’s Indigenization and Economic Empowerment
                        Act.
