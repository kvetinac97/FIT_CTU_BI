                     Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded Afghanistan in 1747. The
                     country served as a buffer between the British and Russian Empires until it won independence
                     from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in increased democracy ended
                     in a 1973 coup and a 1978 communist countercoup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979
                     to support the tottering Afghan communist regime, touching off a long and destructive
                     war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported
                     anti-communist mujahidin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally
                     fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged
                     in 1994 to end the country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001
                     terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action
                     toppled the Taliban for sheltering Usama BIN LADIN.

                  <p>
                     A UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for political reconstruction
                     that included the adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004,
                     and National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the
                     first democratically elected president of Afghanistan, and the National Assembly was
                     inaugurated the following December. KARZAI was reelected in August 2009 for a second
                     term. The 2014 presidential election was the country's first to include a runoff,
                     which featured the top two vote-getters from the first round, Abdullah ABDULLAH and
                     Ashraf GHANI. Throughout the summer of 2014, their campaigns disputed the results
                     and traded accusations of fraud, leading to a US-led diplomatic intervention that
                     included a full vote audit as well as political negotiations between the two camps.
                     In September 2014, GHANI and ABDULLAH agreed to form the Government of National Unity,
                     with GHANI inaugurated as president and ABDULLAH elevated to the newly-created position
                     of chief executive officer. The day after the inauguration, the GHANI administration
                     signed the US-Afghan Bilateral Security Agreement and NATO Status of Forces Agreement,
                     which provide the legal basis for the post-2014 international military presence in
                     Afghanistan. After two postponements, the next presidential election was held in September
                     2019.

                     The Taliban remains a serious challenge for the Afghan Government in almost every
                     province. The Taliban still considers itself the rightful government of Afghanistan,
                     and it remains a capable and confident insurgent force fighting for the withdrawal
                     of foreign military forces from Afghanistan, establishment of sharia law, and rewriting
                     of the Afghan constitution. In 2019, negotiations between the US and the Taliban in
                     Doha entered their highest level yet, building on momentum that began in late 2018.
                     Underlying the negotiations is the unsettled state of Afghan politics, and prospects
                     for a sustainable political settlement remain unclear.

                  <div class="row">
                     <div class="col-12"><b>Overview: </b>
                        Despite improvements in life expectancy, incomes, and literacy since 2001, Afghanistan
                        is extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid. Much of the population
                        continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity, medical care,
                        and jobs. Corruption, insecurity, weak governance, lack of infrastructure, and the
                        Afghan Government's difficulty in extending rule of law to all parts of the country
                        pose challenges to future economic growth. Afghanistan's living standards are among
                        the lowest in the world. Since 2014, the economy has slowed, in large part because
                        of the withdrawal of nearly 100,000 foreign troops that had artificially inflated
                        the country’s economic growth.
                        The international community remains committed to Afghanistan's development, pledging
                        over $83 billion at ten donors' conferences between 2003 and 2016. In October 2016,
                        the donors at the Brussels conference pledged an additional $3.8 billion in development
                        aid annually from 2017 to 2020. Even with this help, Government of Afghanistan still
                        faces number of challenges, including low revenue collection, anemic job creation,
                        high levels of corruption, weak government capacity, and poor public infrastructure.
                        In 2017 Afghanistan's growth rate was only marginally above that of the 2014-2016
                        average. The drawdown of international security forces that started in 2012 has negatively
                        affected economic growth, as a substantial portion of commerce, especially in the
                        services sector, has catered to the ongoing international troop presence in the country.
                        Afghan President Ashraf GHANI Ahmadzai is dedicated to instituting economic reforms
                        to include improving revenue collection and fighting corruption. The government has
                        implemented reforms to the budget process and in some other areas. However, many other
                        reforms will take time to implement and Afghanistan will remain dependent on international
                        donor support over the next several years.
